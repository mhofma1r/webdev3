## Coding Style

### General Principles

### PHP

#### Standards

- Follow PSR-12.
- Follow PSR-4 autoloading.
- Always use:

```php
declare(strict_types=1);
```

- Use type hints for parameters and return values.
- Prefer Dependency Injection over global state or static services.
- Avoid business logic in views/templates.
- Use exceptions for exceptional situations.

#### Example

```php
public function findById(int $id): ?User
{
    return $this->repository->find($id);
}
```

---

### JavaScript

#### Standards

- Prefer `const` over `let`, and `let` over `var`.
- Use strict equality (`===` and `!==`).
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility.
- Avoid global variables.
- Use descriptive names.
- Prefer modern ES6+ syntax.

#### Example

```javascript
const user = await api.getUser(id);

if (user === null) {
    return;
}
```

---

#### Standards

- Use semantic HTML whenever possible.
- Keep markup clean and properly indented.
- Prefer accessibility-friendly elements.

    </article>
</main>
```

### CSS

#### Standards

- Prefer reusable classes over inline styles.

Write code as if the next person maintaining it is a tired developer reading it at 3 AM during an outage.
